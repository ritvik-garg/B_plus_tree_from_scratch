## **DS : Assignment-3 (B+ Tree)**

#### Files : 
* 2020201071_a3.cpp
* README.md

#### How to run ?
1. Compile C++ file using command : `g++ 2020201071_a3.cpp`
2. Run the binary file. Also give the `name of file containing queries` as command line arguments, like `./a.out input.txt`.

#### Output :
`output.txt` file is generated containing the results of all the queries in each line.

#### Note :
1. Query should be in `UPPER-CASE`, eg : INSERT, FIND, COUNT, RANGE.
2. Order of the tree : 2, i.e., max_keys = 2, and max_child = 3;
3. Code is implemented in `C++`. 
4. Keys to be stored should only be `integers`.
5. Valid Query and its parameter should be passed in the file, otherwise the code may break.
